# JavaWithMongo

Project for playing around with Java and MongoDB.

### Upcoming...

- Split Maven project into common module and logical module, where common will keep abstractions and logical will implement those abstractions (e.g.: common with dao and service packages, and logical with daoImpl and serviceImpl packages).

- Use my MongoDB Atlas cluster to connect with application.
