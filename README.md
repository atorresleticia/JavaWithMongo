# Java With MongoDB

Project for playing around with Java and MongoDB.

### Upcoming...

- Split Maven project into common module, logical module and rest module, where common stores abstractions and other common features between modules, logical will implement those abstractions and rest stores rest requests (e.g.: common with model, dao and service packages; logical with daoImpl, serviceImpl and validator packages; rest with resource and dto packages).

- Use my MongoDB Atlas cluster to connect with application.
